# Landing-Page
This repository contains the code for a custom interactive landing page I created for the final project of SheCodes Basics Workshop on June 2024. This project is a prerequisite for the workshop and when completed, a certificate is awarded to the student. This landing page was made purely using HTML5, CSS and Javascript.

# Project Requirements
This project required its students to create a custom landing page from scratch about something they're passionate about. In my case, I made the landing page about reading books. The page must also include a user interaction.

# Page User Interaction
This page contains a user interaction where the user will be prompted when they click the 'Share Your Reason' button.

This prompt will pop up until the user enters a valid reason. For example,
