# Landing-Page
This repository containing the code for a custom interactive landing page I created for the final project for SheCodes Basics Workshop on June 2024. This project is a prerequisite for the workshop. When completed, a certificate is awarded to signify the completion of the workshop. This landing page was made purely using HTML5, CSS and Javascript.
